Shaker is a node/electron app with a user interface that allows its user to create dynamic representations
of moving and interacting geometrical objects made up from point and lines.

The UI has two main visible windows:
1. the left window contains panels where the user specifies the 'model' which is 
geometry, positioning and interaction of various visible objects.
2. the right panel is a 'Canvas' for visualizing the model as a drawing.

version 0.1 is the first most simple implementation and lets the users create a point on space that
can be constrained by its X and/or Y location and otherwise move around slowing within its containts.
